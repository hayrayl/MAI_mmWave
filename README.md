# Membership Inference Attacks on mmWave Sensing Models


## Overview

This project investigates Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) against machine learning models that utilize millimeter-wave (mmWave) sensing data. Our goal is to demonstrate the feasibility and implications of such attacks in privacy-sensitive applications leveraging mmWave technology.

Project Duration: Summer REU Program

Institution: Purdue University Cybersecurity

Members: Haylie Rayl, Lucas Lippeatt, Stephen Chien


## Background
Millimeter-wave sensing has emerged as a promising technology for various applications including healthcare monitoring, gesture recognition, and indoor positioning.
However, the privacy implications of machine learning models trained on mmWave data remain underexplored. 
This research examines how membership inference attacks can compromise user privacy in mmWave-based systems.

## Research Objectives
- Evaluate the vulnerability of mmWave-based ML models to membership inference attacks
- Analyze the privacy risks associated with mmWave sensing in different application domains
- Develop and test MIA techniques specifically tailored for mmWave data characteristics
- Propose potential mitigation strategies to enhance privacy protection

## Code 
Generate_Targets.py: trains the Human Activity Recognition (HAR) Model that will be targeted for the membership inference attack.
